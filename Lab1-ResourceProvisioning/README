These services are provided by Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Language and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Vision AI services, respectively. While these services have SDKs for a number of different languages, including Java, Python, JavaScript, and .NET, the easiest way to integrate these services into the conversation is through their REST Service APIs.
